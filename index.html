                        A microscope is a laboratory instrument that can be used to examine cells and other tiny objects.
            <br>
             Through one lens in the microscope, an objectâ€™s picture is enlarged. This lens bends light in a way that causes it to look as though an object is larger than it actually is.

                A microscope enlarges the vision of an object by magnifying an object twice with the objective and oculus lenses. <br>
                <br>

               The magnifying power of a simple microscope is given by: 
                <br>
                <br>

                M    =     1    +    D/F 

                <br>
                <br>

                Where, <br>

                D = the least distance of distinct vision <br>

                F = focal length of the convex lens <br>

                <br>
                <br>

            <li>Somewhere between the two lenses is where this image is produced.</li><br>
            <li>The oculus lens examines the actual image, which has already been magnified, and produces a "virtual image" of it that has been numerously magnified.</li> <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Clean microscope after each use.</li> <br>
                    <li>Use lens paper to polish dirty lenses.</li> <br>
                    <li>Don't exert pressure using a cloth because the lenses are quite delicate.</li> <br>
                    <li>Clean the eyepiece using an alcohol-based wipe after properly wiping out the stage (the platform that contains the slides).</li><br>
                    <li>Carefully handle glass slides. If a slide breaks, make sure the contents are disposed of correctly.</li><br>
                    <li>When not in use, turn off the light source for the microscope. This will improve lamp longevity and save energy.</li><br>
                    <li>Always use two hands to carry the microscope, one to support the base and the other to grasp the arm.</li><br>
                    <li>Place the objective lenses on the lowest setting, lower the nosepiece, and turn off the light source to properly store the microscope.</li><br>
                    <li>Add a dust jacket to the cover.</li><br>
